## Tasks
### - Train Final model using the output of the audio sentiment 
###   valence-arousal regressor models and the lyrics averages as input. 
###   The output should be a more accurate value of the previous estimations

### - Tweak the audio sentiment valence-arousal regressor models to get  
###    better results

### - Modify Thesis Proposal to past tense and remove the implementations 
###   that weren't implemented


## Estimated Deadline
