I want to be the smile
I want to see the change
I want to be your friend from the start and once it starts it never ends
I want to be your pal
I want to be around
I want to be a friend when you are down
I want to be the sunshine on your smiling face
I want to be the moon
No, I want to be the ocean
Where all we do is float under the sun on the rolling sea
Whoa, I want to be the sunshine,
No I want to be the moonshine
I want to be the nighttime lullaby when you are so afraid
And I think I found a way to put a smile on your lonely face
I think I found a way, a way to break down all the walls
I think I found a way to say,
I think I found a way to say hello
I think I found a way
Without saying anything at all
And I think I found a way to put a smile on your lonely face
I think I found a way, a way to break down all the walls
I think I found a way to say,
I think I found a way to say hello
I think I found a way
Without saying anything at all
