Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing a burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

The pain is real
As a cut that bleeds
The face I see
Every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

I'm running from the enemy inside
(The enemy inside)
Looking for the life I left behind
(The life I left behind)
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
I shut down completely
Alone in my own living hell
Overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
If I fall and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying

I'm running from the enemy inside
(The enemy inside)
Looking for the life I left behind
(The life I left behind)
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden, I'm a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Dream of flashbacks and of violent screams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise comes to an end
And no magic pill
Can bring it back again

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside
