I am the river flowing
I am the desert dry
I am the four winds blowing
I am the sunset sky

I am the forest breathing
I am the ocean wide
I am the storm clouds gathering
I am the mountain high

I am the Earth
I am the Earth
I am the Earth
I am the Earth

We are the children growing
You are the place we live
We are the seed you are sowing
We are the life you give

We are the future rising
We will be your voice
We will watch and learn from you
We will make the choice

I am the Earth
You're in our hands
I am the Earth
We are in your care
I am the Earth
Together we stand
I am the Earth
This moment in time we share

I am the river flowing
We are the children growing
I am the desert dry 
You are the place we live
I am the four winds blowing
We are the seed you are sowing
I am the sunset sky
We are the life you give
I am the forest breathing
We will be your voice
I am the storm clouds gathering
We will make the choice

We share the future
Stand side by side
One Earth, one people
We will turn the tide
And in the future
They will say with pride
One Earth, one people
We turned the tide

Side by side
