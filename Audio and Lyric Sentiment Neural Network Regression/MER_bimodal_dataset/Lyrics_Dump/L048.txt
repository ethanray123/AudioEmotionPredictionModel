You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs

You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through that door at the end of the day...

I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night

When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling all right

When you just roll over and turn out the light...
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural

It used to be...

To talk about forever

Mmm...

But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away

And baby I remember all the things you taught me

I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry

Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers any more...

Well, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye...

'Cause you don't say you need me;

You don't sing me love songs;

You don't bring me flowers anymore...
