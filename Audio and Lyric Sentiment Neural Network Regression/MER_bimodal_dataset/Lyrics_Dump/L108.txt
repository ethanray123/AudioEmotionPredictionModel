Somewhere, over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up
Where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melt like lemon drops away above
The chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I?

When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane to a place behind the sun
Just a step behind the rain

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?
