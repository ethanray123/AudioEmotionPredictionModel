Tired of living like my days are bad
When I open up my eyes, I'm glad
And I can't complain 'bout yesterday
Cuz today's a brand new day

Comb my hair and though some like it wrong
Jump in my ride because it's on
And I'm gone, I'm gone

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord
Cuz it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say

Even though it's cloudy 
I can see the sun rays
Oh, cuz it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Cuz it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day

Life just can't get no better than this
Mother Nature's given us a kiss
Cuz tomorrow I'm glad I didn't miss
Let's take advantage of days like this
When the night time does finally hit
There'll be no reason for guns
It'll be fun, fun, fun, fun

Everything is good because I'm living and I'm healthy
I'm not too concerned 'bout being poor or being wealthy
I feel really good about this blessing given to me
Nothing in this world could ever take all my joy from me

It's beautiful, it's beautiful
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
It's beautiful

A beautiful day, a beautiful day
A beautiful day, a beautiful day

I don't have a complain in the world
I am doing so good 
Without, without, without the money
Without, without, without the stress
Without, without, without the people, oh yeah
