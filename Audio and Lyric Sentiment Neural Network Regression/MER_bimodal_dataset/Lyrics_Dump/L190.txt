Friends are quiet angels 
Who lift us to our feet 
When our wings have trouble remembering how to fly 
They stand by us and give us 
the strength to try 

Friends are quiet angels 
Who somehow make you see 
The light that's in the darkness 
before the dawn 
All at once the journeys not so long 

But it's the laughter and the fun 
Sometimes the feeling that we're one 
All the tears we cry together you and I 
That will keep us heart to heart 
as time goes by 

Friends are quiet angels 
Who fill your life with grace 
Thrilled to share your joy 
when a dream comes true 
And on this special day* 
I'm blessed 'cause I can say 
I've found a quiet angel 
You're a special angel 
I found a quiet angel in you
