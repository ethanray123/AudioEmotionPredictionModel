Give me the music

Everybody dance now

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody dance now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everybody dance now

Here is the doe, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
Or the mike if it don't rhyme
Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm, jump
And I'm here to provide
Peace and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make a whirl
It's your world and I'm just a swirl
Trying to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on say, yeah
Everybody over here everybody over there
The crowd is live and I feel this groove
Party people in the house

Move
(Let your mind)

Move
(Put me online)
Come on let's sweat, baby

Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat

Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Everybody dance now

Everybody dance now
Pause take a breath go for yours
On my command now hit the dance floors
I'm gonna make you sweat till you bleed
Is that enough, indeed
I pay the price, control the dice

I'm more precise, to a point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Oh, your body is free and a whole
Dance till you can't dance
Till you can't dance no more

Get on the floor and get warm

Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya
Move
(Let your mind)
Move

(Put me online)
The music is my life
Everybody dance now

Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
