You touched my life
With the softness in the night
My wish was your command
Until you ran out of love

I tell myself I'm free
Got the chance of livin' just for me
No need to hurry home
Now that you're gone

Knife
Cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal
I'm so deeply wounded
Knife
Cuts like a knife
You cut away the heart of my life

When I pretend
Wear a smile to fool my dearest friends
I wonder if they know
It's just a show

I'm on a stage
Day and night I go through my charades
But how can I disguise
What's in my eyes

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh'

I've tried and tried
Blocking out the pain I feel inside
The pain of wanting you
Wanting you

Knife
Cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal
I'm so deeply wounded

You cut away the heart
Of my life
