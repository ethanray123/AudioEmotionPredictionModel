Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great.

You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?

Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
And who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?

You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around

When you break?
You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothin's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
Oh, you know you can't go on, thinkin'
Nothin's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
