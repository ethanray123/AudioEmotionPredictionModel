Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
Up in New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging swaying records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
They'll be dancing
They're dancing in the street

It's just an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing, singing, music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore and D.C. now
Can't forget the Motor City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on ev'ry guy grab a girl
Ev'rywhere around the world

Dancing
They're dancing in the street
Way down in L.A.
Every day
(Dancing in the street)
Across the ocean blue, me and you
We're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
