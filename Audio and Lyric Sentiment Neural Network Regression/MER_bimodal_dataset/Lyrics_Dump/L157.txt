Let's dance
Put on your red shoes
And dance the blues

Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance for fear your grace should fall
Let's dance for fear tonight is all

Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight,
This serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes
And dance the blues

Let's dance to the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway under the moonlight,
This serious moonlight

Let's dance
Let's sway
