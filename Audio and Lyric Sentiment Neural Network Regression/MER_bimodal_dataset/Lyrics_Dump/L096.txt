I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love

Someone, yes, someone to love
Someone to kiss
Someone to hold
At a moment like this

I'd like to hear
Somebody say
I'll give you my love
Each night and day

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love

Somebody, somebody
Somebody, please
Send her to me
I'll make her happy
Just wait and see

I prayed so hard
To the heavens above
That I might find
Someone to love

I'm just a lonely boy
lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love
