Come on, step inside, and you will realize.
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be.
What's your vision?
You'll see, what do you expect of me?
I cant live that lie.

Hey!
I've sick mom,
With a fucked dad.
Dealing with your life.
Dead bodies everywhere. 
You!
Really want me to be a good son. Why?
You make me feel like no one. 

Let me strip the plain, let me not give in.
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies.
Your dreams never achieved, don't lay that shit on me.
Let me live my... life.

You want me to be, something I can never ever be!

Dead bodies everywhere!
