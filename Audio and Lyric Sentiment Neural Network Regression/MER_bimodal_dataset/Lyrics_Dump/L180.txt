Through falling leaves I pick my way slowly 
Talking aloud - eases my mind 
Sunlight filters through - I feel my head is drifting 
So full of thoughts - I thought 
What am I going to do? 
I need some thoughts that are new

Doo doo doo... 
Dee dee dee ... 
Nature - enter me

Up in a tree a bird sings so sweetly 
Nature's own voice - I hear 
Rustling whistling leaves turning breeze to speech 
Call to me now - ease my mind 
I'll turn something new 
My mind's laid with dew

Nature - enter me

I'll turn something new 
My mind's laid with dew

Nature - enter me
