Please remember me forever
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

I'm gonna tell you what I think about you in that unforgivable way I do
You're an idiot
And I hate your guts
I guess I'm about as happy for you as I would be a cockroach in my food
I know it's terrible
I really hate you though

Do you have your fairytale lie
Or are you dancing to the white trash twist
Oh please remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

I heard the thing that you hate about me almost everyday, but you still wouldn't leave
I had to pull the plug
Ooh, I hated your guts
And I heard the opposite of love isn't hate
It's indifference
But I can't relate
It's not good enough
Cause I hate your guts

Did you settle your mediocre mind
You had the fine wine you're better off with Bud Light

Oh please remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well
Oh please remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who wants you to go to hell

You're roaring, you're boring
Oh, did you hear me snoring?
I'd wanna mutilate myself when I talk to you
So here we are, I hope you can tell that I'm no referral
You can have 'em, call hell
You're gonna drive 'em nuts
They're gonna hate your guts
