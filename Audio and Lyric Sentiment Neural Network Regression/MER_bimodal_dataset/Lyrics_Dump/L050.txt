We got it together, didn't we?
We definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?
Isn't that nice?
I mean, when you really sit and think about it, isn't it really, really nice?
I can easily feel myself slipping more and more ways
Slip in world of my own
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together, baby

The first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're all I'm living for
Your love I'll keep for evermore
You're the first, you're the last, my everything

In you I've found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
Can't you see if you, you make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many way that I
Can love you till the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl you're my reality
But I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything

You and me, babe
Just you and me
You are the first, the last, my everything
