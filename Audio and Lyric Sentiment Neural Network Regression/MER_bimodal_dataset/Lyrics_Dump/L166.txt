(Ah, ah) You left me sleeping
(Ah, ah) in my bed

I should have been with you instead


Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go

You turned a bright spark into a flame ( Yeah, yeah)

(Ah, ah) I'm your fool
(Ah, ah) It makes me crazy
(Ah, ah) when you act so cruel
