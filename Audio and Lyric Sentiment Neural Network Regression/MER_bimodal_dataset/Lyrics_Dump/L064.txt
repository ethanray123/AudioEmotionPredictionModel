I'm coming down to see ya
I'm looking for fast and cheap
I'm looking for the black moon streets

I'm gonna get experience
I've been to see the candy man
Just turn it up and drown

He said
Feels just like it should
Yeah-ow
Feels just like it should
Yeah-ow
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should (I'm gonna get experience)
Feels just like it should (turn it up and drown)

I'm throwing out my laser beam
To shoot some cherries down
I pick a little free agent
I've got myself a five mile smile

So take me for the first time
I need a little sugar spice
I wanna see the city lights
I'm gonna find a lover

She said
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
I'm looking for fast and cheap

Feels just like it should (I'm looking for the city streets)
Feels just like it should (gonna get experience)
Feels just like it should (I'm here to see the candy man)
Feels just like it should

Sugar-spice, I'm on the phone
I'm outside
I need a little sexfunk right now
I want you
I'm gonna lick you up and down
Feels good
She said it would feel that good
and it does

Yeah-ow
Yeah-ow
and it feels, it feels, it feels
and it feels, it feels, it feels
and it feels, it feels, it feels
just like you
just like you said it would
Yeah-ow

Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
I'm coming down tonight to taste y'all
Sugar-spice, I want you, a sexy girl
slips in, it feels good
I love it when you tell me
