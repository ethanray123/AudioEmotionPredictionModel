In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad, go mad

In my solitude, In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back the one I love
