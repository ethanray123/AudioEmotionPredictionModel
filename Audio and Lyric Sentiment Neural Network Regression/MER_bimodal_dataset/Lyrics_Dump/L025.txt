Is it right or wrong
Try to find a place
We can all belong?

Be as one
Try to get on by
If we unify
We should really try

All this time
Spinning round and round
Made the same mistakes
That we've always found

Surely now
We could move along
Make a better world
No, it can't be wrong

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah

Time is running out
Let there be no doubt
We should sort things out

If we care
Like we say we do
Not just empty words
For a week or two

Make the world
Your priority
Try to live your life
Ecologically

Play a part
In a greater scheme
Try to live the dream
On a wider scene

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Oh yeah

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Oh yeah
