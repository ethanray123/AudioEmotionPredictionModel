Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes, each girl he passes goes, ah

When he walks he's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when he passes each girl, he passes goes, ah

Oh, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, and tan, and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes I smile but he doesn't see
No, he doesn't see, he doesn't see me

How can I tell him I love him?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, and tan, and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes I smile but he doesn't see
He just doesn't see, he just doesn't see
