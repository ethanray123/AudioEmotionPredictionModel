I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me

(So what do you need)

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet

(been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on hollywood boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
I think I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and
Today's who's who
They'll get you anything
With that evil smile
Everybody's got a
Drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills
From a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sing em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

'cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and
Today's who's who

Drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
