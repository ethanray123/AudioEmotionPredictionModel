On an ocean white
Of roaring waves
I see your light
In golden fades
A precious gift
Of your longing arms
Hurt me not
Just sing to me, my love
Calm
How calm
So
So
Sweetly, child, you sing
And all the joy you bring to me
Comes
'Cause our loved ones hold
And I will, I will be waiting
On an ocean
Sweetly, child, you sing
On an ocean
On an ocean
So calm
Song
