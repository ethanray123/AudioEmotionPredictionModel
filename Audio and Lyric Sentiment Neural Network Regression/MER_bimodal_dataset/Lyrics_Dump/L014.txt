Quiet nights of quiet stars 
Quiet cords from my guitar 
Floating on the silence that surrounds us 

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams 
Quiet walks by quiet streams 
And the window looking on the mountains and the sea how lovely 
This is where i want to be 
Here with you so close to me 
Until the final flicker of life's ember 

I who was lost and lonely 
Believing life was only 
A bitter tragic joke 
Have found with you 
The meaning of existence 
Oh my love 

This is where i want to be 
Here with you so close to me 
Until the final flicker of life's ember 
I who was lost and lonely 
Believing life was only 
A bitter tragic joke 
Have found with you 
The meaning of existence 
Oh my love
