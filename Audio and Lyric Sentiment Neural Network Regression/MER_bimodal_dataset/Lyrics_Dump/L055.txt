Here we are folks
The dream we all dream off
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
Tell me, have you got the look?
You walked in, I woke up
I never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
You got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me takin aback

You've got the look, youve got the hook
You shonuf do be cookin in my book
Your face is jammin
Your bodys heck-a-slammin
If love is good, lets get 2 rammin
You got the look, you got the look

Look here
You got the look (you got the look)
You musta took (you musta took)
A whole hour just 2 make up your face, baby
Closin time, ugly lights, everybodys inspected (everybodys inspected)
But you are a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected (I stand corrected)

You've got the look, youve got the hook

Your face is jammin
Your bodys heck-a-slammin
