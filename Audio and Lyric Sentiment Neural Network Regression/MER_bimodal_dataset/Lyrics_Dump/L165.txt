Can you see, can you see the light
glowing hope, sprinkling love

there, from the sky?



The warm gleam that's

soothing your heart

sees itself in this mirror of mine



Imagine your world without me

No golden days

No precious dreams to dream



Will you, please, take care of me?



Long ago and far from here

there was peace, there was love

for all eternity



What's the future that awaits us all

since you won't look to the sky?



Can you smell the sweetness of flower buds?

Can you hear the singing trees and birds?



I'm the reason for

them to please the world,

for every soul, for every life

to unfurl



I'm the source of all that's good



Save me so I can save you

Look into the sun, feel the warmth,

smell the flourishing dreams

See yourself in me

Hear the calling of the water song... water song...

Save yourself and save us all
