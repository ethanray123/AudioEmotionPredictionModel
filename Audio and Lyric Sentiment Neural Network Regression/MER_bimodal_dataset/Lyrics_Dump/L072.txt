Roses are red, violets are blue
Believe me, I love you
Let's not be apart
Because you're the rose of my heart
My sweet rose, you are my queen

You're my Miss Jamaica
My Miss Jamaica
You're my Miss Jamaica
I'm crowning you myself

Although you may not have such a fabulous shape
To suit the rest of the world
But you do suit me and that's all I want to know
I need not know nothing more

You're my Miss Jamaica
My Miss Jamaica
You're my Miss Jamaica
I'm crowning you myself

Although you may not have such a fabulous shape
To suit the rest of the world
But you do suit me and that's all I want to know
I need not know nothing more

You're my Miss Jamaica
My Miss Jamaica
You're my Miss Jamaica
I'm crowning you myself
Because you're my Miss Jamaica, Miss Jamaica, Miss Jamaica
