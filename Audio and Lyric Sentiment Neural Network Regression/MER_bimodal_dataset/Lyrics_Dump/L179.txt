There is a land, an ancient land.

It bears a vast and rugged face.

Its spirits deep, haunting and free.

It calls to you, it calls to me.

Come find your soul, within my depths.

Come make of me, your homeland true.

This is our land, we are its people

A nation that’s free to realise its dream.

A dream that’s for all who dwell in this land.

To live as one people, one people one land.

There is a people, an ancient people.

Their spirits rest deep in this land.

Their dreamtime myth, story and faith,

Make this land a sacred place.

They seek of all a true embrace,

That reconciles all that we are.

And from distant shores many have come

To find their home in this great southern land

Where the spirit yearns and seeks to unite us all
