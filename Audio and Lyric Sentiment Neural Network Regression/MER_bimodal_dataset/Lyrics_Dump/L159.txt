I used to walk between the shadows
Lost in a world that moved too fast
I was afraid I'd always be alone
Then I saw your face at last

I found my way even in the dark
Though at times it seemed too far
I knew if I'd listen to my heart
I'd find that love is where you are

I close my eyes and see tomorrow
My dreams begin and end with you
I hear you say you'll be there
Always for me
Then I must believe it's true

I found my way even in the dark
Though at times it seemed too far
I knew if I'd listen to my heart
I'd find that love is where you are

Love is where you are
And anywhere you are
Is where I want to be
No matter what may happen
No matter where I go
Your arms are home to me

I found my way even in the dark
Though at times it seemed too far
Somehow I knew even at first sight
That love is anywhere you are
Love is where you are
Love is where you are
