Some call it faith, some call it love. 
Some call it guidance from above. 
You are the reason we found ours, 
So thank you stars. 

Some people think it's far away, 
Some know it's with them everyday. 
You are the reason we found ours, 
So thank you stars. 

There are no winds that can blow it away on the air, 
When they try to blow it away 's when you know it will always be there. 

To some it's the strength to be apart, 
To some it's a feeling in the heart. 
And when you're out there on your own, it's the way back home. 

There are no winds that can blow it away on the air, 
When they try to blow it away 's when you know it will always be there. 
Some call it faith, some call it love. 
Some call it guidance from above. 
You are the reason we found ours, 
So thank you stars. 
Thank you stars, 
Thank you stars, 
Thank you stars
