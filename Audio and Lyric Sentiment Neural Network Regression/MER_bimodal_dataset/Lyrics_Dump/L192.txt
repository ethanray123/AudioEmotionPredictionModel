Some, have a daughter.
Some, have a son.
Some, have many cousins.
Some, have none. 

Some are very big and
Some are very small.
But it really doesn't matter at all.

Because a family is a family
When there's love in the air.
Maybe a dozen
Or maybe a pair.
A family is a family
Whether twelve or two.
We could be a family.
Just me and you.

Some, have a father.
Some, have a mom.
Some, have aunts and uncles.
Some, have none.

Some are very big and
Some are very small.
But it really doesn't matter at all.

Some, have a sister.
Some, have a brother.
Some, have Grandfather.
Some, have Grandmother.

Some are very big and
Some are very small.
But it really doesn't matter at all.

Some, have a puppy.
Some, have a cat.
Some, have a llama.
Now what, do you think about that?

Some are very big and
Some are very small.
But it really doesn't matter at all.
