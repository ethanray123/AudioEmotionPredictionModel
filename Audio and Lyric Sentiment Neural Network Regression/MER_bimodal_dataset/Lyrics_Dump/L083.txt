Let me sail, let me sail
Let the orinoco flow
Let me reach, let me beach
On the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail
Let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach
Far beyond the Yellow Sea
De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De

Sail away,sail away, sail away [x4]

From Bissau to Palau - in the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu hear the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali - far beneath the Coral Sea

De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De
Turn it up, Turn it up, Turn it up, up, Adieu, Ohhhh
Turn it up, Turn it up, Turn it up, up, Adieu, Ohhhh
Turn it up, Turn it up, Turn it up, up, Adieu, Ohhhh

Sail away, sail away, sail away [x4]

From the North to the South
Ebudae into Khartoum
From the deep sea of Clouds
To the island of the moon
Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never been
Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never seen

We can sail, we can sail
With the orinoco flow 
We can sail, we can sail...(Sail away, Sail away, Sail away)
We can steer, we can near
With Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say goodbye
Ross and his dependency
We can sail, we can sail...(Sail away, Sail away, Sail away)
