I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie and every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away
It's still a mystery to me

Well I'm so empty
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well you're so unclean
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me

The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred (deceiving), the beatings; it's over

Paint the mirrors black to forget you
I still picture your face and the way you used to taste
Roses in a glass, dead and wilted
To you this all was nothing
Everything to you is nothing

Well you're so filthy
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well I'm so ugly
You're better off without me and I'm better off alone

The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings (disaster); it's over

As wicked as you are, you're beautiful to me
You're the darkest burning star, you're my perfect disease

The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings; it's over
Disaster
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings; it's over
Disaster

It's over now...
