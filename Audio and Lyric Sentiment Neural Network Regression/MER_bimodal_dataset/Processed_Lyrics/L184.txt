every time rain come down close eye listen hear alone sound sky cry  listen rain come hear rain  feel touch tear fall they fall ever way day flow thing come thing go  listen rain the rain come again again hear rain the rain  late night drift away  hear call name rain leave tree whisper deep blue sea mystery  even moment end cant let go feel every thing come sound fall down sky cry hear name rain
